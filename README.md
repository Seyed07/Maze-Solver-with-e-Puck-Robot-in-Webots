# Maze Solver with e‑Puck Robot in Webots

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository demonstrates a maze-solving approach in a 4×4 environment using an e‑Puck robot simulated in Webots. The robot employs infrared proximity sensors to detect walls and applies a **Depth‑First Search (DFS)** algorithm with a **stack-based implementation** to navigate from the starting cell (ID 3) to the maze's center.

An alternative version using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** can also be implemented for shortest-path exploration, but the current version focuses on DFS.

## 📥 Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<username>/maze-solver-epuck.git
cd maze-solver-epuck
```

## ▶️ Running the Simulation
1. Launch Webots.
2. Open the world file: **File → Open World → worlds/maze.wbt**.
3. In the Robot Controller panel, select `my_controller.py`.
4. Press the ▶️ Run button to start the simulation.

## ⚙️ Sensor and Motor Configuration
```python
# Infrared proximity sensors: front, right, rear, left
psNames = ['ps0', 'ps7', 'ps3', 'ps4']
threshold = 80  # sensor reading above this indicates a wall

# Configure wheel motors for infinite rotation and zero speed initially
leftMotor.setPosition(float('inf'))
rightMotor.setPosition(float('inf'))
leftMotor.setVelocity(0)
rightMotor.setVelocity(0)
```

## 🧠 DFS Algorithm with Stack
This simulation uses an iterative **Depth‑First Search (DFS)** algorithm with an explicit **stack**:

1. **Node Representation**: Each maze cell is represented by a `node` object with:
   - `id`: Cell identifier
   - `dir`: Entry direction
   - `searched`: Boolean flag for visitation

2. **Stack Logic**:
```python
stack = []
stack.append(start_node)  # Push starting node (ID 3)

while stack:
    current = stack[-1]  # Peek top of stack
    if not current.searched:
        stack = search(current, stack, duration)  # Explore neighbors
    else:
        stack.pop()  # Backtrack if fully searched
```

3. **Search Functionality**: The `search()` function does the following:
   - Uses sensor data to determine wall presence
   - Prioritizes directions: right → forward → left
   - Pushes reachable, unvisited neighbors onto the stack
   - Backtracks (pops) when no paths are available

## 🔁 Recursive DFS Sample (Alternative)
```python
visited = set()

def dfs_recursive(node):
    visited.add(node)
    if node == goal:
        return True
    for direction in ['right', 'forward', 'left']:
        if is_free(direction):
            nxt = move(direction)
            if nxt not in visited and dfs_recursive(nxt):
                return True
            backtrack()
    return False

# Start search
dfs_recursive(start_node)
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- **Return Path Accuracy**: The robot might slightly misalign when returning due to `delay()` timing inconsistencies.
- **Manual Delay Calibration**: Rotation delays may require manual fine-tuning for accurate navigation.
