# Maze-Solver-with-e-Puck-Robot-in-Webots
This repository demonstrates pathfinding in a 4×4 maze using an e‑Puck robot in the Webots simulator. The robot uses infrared proximity sensors to detect walls and performs a depth‑first search (DFS) with a stack to navigate from the start cell (ID 3) to the center of the maze.
